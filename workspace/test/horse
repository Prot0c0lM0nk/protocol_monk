The Trail Ahead

Well, this is it. My first cattle drive. I can already tell these cows don't know what they're in for. Look at them, milling about like they own the place. Wait 'til they see what I can do when they step out of line.

My partner Pete seems nervous. He keeps checking his gear and adjusting his hat. Humans. Always so fidgety before the real work begins. I've been walking point at number two in the herd for three seasons now, and I know my job. The cattle respect that. Well, the smart ones do.

There's a big red steer eyeing the edge of the group. Thinking about making a break for it, probably. Let him try. I'll cut him off before he gets twenty feet. These greenhorns don't understand how this works. They think they can just wander off whenever they please. Not on my watch.

Pete's calling out something about staying together. I don't need to hear it. I've got this. I love this spot - right behind the lead horse, setting the pace, keeping everyone in line. This is what I was born for.

The cattle are starting to move out. Good. Let's see what they're made of.
