Tool Usage Guide:
- Line numbers are 1-based and end line numbers are INCLUSIVE
- Use read_file first to get exact line numbers before using replace_lines or delete_lines
- Use replace_lines for replacing code blocks (shows diff of changes)
- Use insert_in_file to add content after a specific line (exact match required)
- Use delete_lines to remove specific line ranges (shows deleted lines)
- Use append_to_file to add content to the END of a file
- Use create_file to create new files
- For large content, the system auto-stages to scratch files
- All tools handle atomic writes and show detailed output

Tool call format:
You must wrap the JSON in a markdown code block labeled 'json'.
Do not output raw JSON. Do not mix JSON with text outside the block.

Example:
I will list the files now.
```json
{
    "action": "execute_command",
    "parameters": {
        "command": "ls -la",
        "timeout": 30
    },
    "reasoning": "Checking directory contents"
}
